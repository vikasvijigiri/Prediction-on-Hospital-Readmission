# Prediction-on-Hospital-Readmission

## Aim: Predicting Hospital Readmission Data based on certain Health Parameters:
- Diagnosis Type
    - Diabetes, Heart Disease, Injury, Infection
- Gender
- Number of Medications
- Number of Lab Procedures
- Number of Diagnoses
- A1C Result
    - Check of blood sugar levels prior to two months of diagnosis.
- Number of Inpatient Visits
- Number of Outpatient Visits
- Number of Emergency Visits

### We follow the standard protocol :
1. Data Collection
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Feature Engineering
4. Feature Selection
5. Modeling
6. Validation
7. Deployment



# Here we explored various ML alogrithm with accuracies:
- Decision Trees ()
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- SVM
- KNN
- CatBoost
- Logistic Regression

We use Forward Selection technique to select a subset of features for faster and accurate predictions the Hospital Readmission variable
